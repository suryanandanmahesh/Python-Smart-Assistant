# There is an admin mode inside the smart assistant. It is a fun thing that I included in the code so that you can prank your friends. In order to access it, you will need to use your keyboard so type "keyboard" in the initial setup and then type "admin" and it will ask you for a passcode then type "admin1234" and then there will also be 2 more steps of verification one will show a pin which you have o type and the other will say a pin.
